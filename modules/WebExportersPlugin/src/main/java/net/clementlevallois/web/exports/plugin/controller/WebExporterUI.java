/**
 * Settings user interface implementation for the JPG export.
 * <p>
 * It provides the name and the panel for configuring the file export. The
 * <code>setup()</code> method is called first to set the exporter which is
 * going to be configured. Then the <code>getPanel()</code> method is called, 
 * the panel is shown and closed and finally the <code>unsetup()</code> method
 * is called to write settings back to the exporter.
 * <p>
 * This example also shows a convenient way to save settings between export
 * execution. Because this class is a singleton (it implements ServiceProvider)
 * the <code>settings</code> variable will stay as long as the program runs.
 * <p>
 * Make sure to unset <code>panel</code> and <code>exporter</code> in the
 * <code>unsetup()</code> method so it can be GCed.
