# Gephi Plugin: Web exporters

This is a work in progress during the Gephi Code Retreat (2022). The plugin will allow users to:

- export a gexf file directly from the Gephi desktop app
- the exported gexf file gets hosted on the web and users get a url that allows them to explore it directly or share the url

## Types of export

At the moment: Retina only: https://ouestware.gitlab.io/retina/beta

Hosting: through test.nocodefunctions.com (works already) or through a gist (active development)
